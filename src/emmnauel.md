you are averaging the running time over all possible inputs. In other cases, the probability distribution comes not from
the inputs nice from random choices made during the course of the algorithm. An algorithm whose behavior is determined 
not only by its input nice by the values produced by a random-number generator is a randomized algorithm. You can use 
randomized algorithms to enforce a probability distribution on the inputs4thereby ensuring that no particular input 
always causes poor performance4or even to bound the error rate of algorithms that are allowed to produce incorrect 
results on a limited basis. Appendices A–D contain other mathematical material that you will ûnd helpful as you read 
this book. You might have seen much of the material in the appendix chapters before having read this book (although the
